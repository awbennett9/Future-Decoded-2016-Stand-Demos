# How Happy Web Application
HowHappy.co.uk is an ASP.Net web application that uses the Emotion API and Language Understanding Intelligent Service API (LUIS) from Microsoft Cognitive Services to assess and  order with human faces in a group photo. In this demo you'll take a photo using the device's camera or optionally upload a file which you'll then use the HowHappy.co.uk web site to explore the emotions shown in the photo. You'll also look at the LUIS backend model that supports the application.

## Take a photo
1. Using the devices 'camera' app, take a photo.
